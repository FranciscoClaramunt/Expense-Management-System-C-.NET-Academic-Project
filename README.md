# Expense-Management-System-C-.NET-Academic-Project
Academic team project developed for the Programming 2 course at Universidad ORT Uruguay.

The project consists of an expense and payment management system, designed and implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The domain was modeled using UML class diagrams, including inheritance, polymorphism, validations, and collection handling.

The solution was implemented in C# with .NET 8, including a console application and a web application built with ASP.NET MVC, featuring role-based access, business logic separation, and deployment to Microsoft Azure.

This project was developed as part of an academic evaluation, following course constraints (no LINQ, explicit validations, layered architecture).
